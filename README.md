# SQL
Through my data analysis using SQL, I gained valuable insights into Maven Toy Stores. By leveraging SQL queries, I extracted and analyzed data related to sales, inventory, customer behavior, and financial performance. This analysis allowed me to optimize inventory, tailor marketing strategies, and improve customer experiences for the toy stores.
